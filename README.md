# TI6 Predictions 

Inspired by [this](https://yasp.co/ti6predictions) I wanted to make something similar.

Why?

Yasp did a great job, but considered too much games(games before 6.88b and some non-pro games too).

This a work in progress and it's currently missing a lot of stuff, code is messy and could be buggy too.

## Requirements

I used a lot of libraries like **Requests** and **BeautifulSoup**.

If you want to try this out you'll also need a Steam Api Key, you can find it [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
